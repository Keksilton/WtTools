# WtTools

Project that aims to create a set of datamining tools for War Thunder and compatible games.

This project wouldn't be possible without [klensy/wt-tools](https://github.com/klensy/wt-tools) and [kotiq](https://github.com/kotiq), who have done most of the work related to the project.
I simply implemented them in C#.

Web interface with limited capabilities: https://keksilton.github.io/WtTools.Web/

## To do
- [x] Support for .vromfs.bin
- [x] Support for .blk
- [x] Support for .wrpl
- [ ] Full support for strict output
- [ ] Add logging
